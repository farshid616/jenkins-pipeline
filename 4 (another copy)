Ansi Color Build Wrapper 
Synopsis
This shows usage of a simple build wrapper, specifically the AnsiColor plugin, which adds ANSI coloring to the console output.

// This shows a simple build wrapper example, using the AnsiColor plugin.
node {
    // This displays colors using the 'xterm' ansi color map.
    ansiColor('xterm') {
        // Just some echoes to show the ANSI color.
        stage "\u001B[31mI'm Red\u001B[0m Now not"
    }
}
Archive Build Output Artifacts 
Synopsis
This is a simple demonstration of how to archive the build output artifacts in workspace for later use.

// This shows a simple example of how to archive the build output artifacts.
node {
    stage "Create build output"
    
    // Make the output directory.
    sh "mkdir -p output"

    // Write an useful file, which is needed to be archived.
    writeFile file: "output/usefulfile.txt", text: "This file is useful, need to archive it."

    // Write an useless file, which is not needed to be archived.
    writeFile file: "output/uselessfile.md", text: "This file is useless, no need to archive it."

    stage "Archive build output"
    
    // Archive the build output artifacts.
    archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'output/*.txt', excludes: 'output/*.md'
}
